PPMI data
============

The Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) is a global research effort aimed at identifying biomarkers for Parkinson's disease. PPMI is sponsored by the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research and involves collaboration among academic, industry, and nonprofit organizations. The initiative seeks to accelerate the development of new treatments for Parkinson's by identifying biomarkers that can help predict and track disease progression. PPMI includes a number of studies that aim to collect data on various types of biomarkers, including imaging biomarkers, genetic biomarkers, and biofluid biomarkers. By sharing data and resources across the scientific community, PPMI hopes to better understand the underlying biology of Parkinson's disease and identify new approaches to diagnosis and treatment. The ultimate goal of PPMI is to improve the lives of individuals living with Parkinson's by accelerating the development of more effective therapies.
