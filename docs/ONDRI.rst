============

The Ontario Neurodegenerative Research Initiative (ONDRI) is a 3-year study that collected comprehensive data, including 3T structural MRI, from patients with different neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and cerebrovascular disease. The study used a semi-automated MRI processing pipeline to effectively quantify regional brain tissue volumes and neurovascular marker data, which can be accessed publicly. This paper provides a conceptual overview of the ONDRI neuroimaging pipeline, which was designed to address the challenges posed by the heterogeneity of the patient population.
