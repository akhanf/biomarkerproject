# The PD Biomarker Project

Welcome to The PD Biomarker Project, an open-source initiative dedicated to identifying biomarkers for Parkinson's disease (PD).

## Our Mission

Our mission is to accelerate the discovery and validation of biomarkers for PD by fostering collaboration between researchers, clinicians, and patients.

## How You Can Help

We welcome contributions from anyone with an interest in PD research. Here are some ways you can get involved:

- **Contribute data:** If you have PD data, you can share it with us to help us identify potential biomarkers. Contact us at [data@pdbiomarkerproject.org](mailto:data@pbdiomarkerproject.org) for more information.

- **Contribute code:** If you have experience with data analysis, machine learning, or another relevant field, you can contribute code to our open-source repository. Check out our [GitHub page](https://github.com/pdbiomarkerproject) to see our current projects.
